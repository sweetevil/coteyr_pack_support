    # Sharpen an image using an unsharp mask filter.
    # 
    #   image.unsharp_mask(options = {})
    #
    # Use the following keys in the +options+ hash:
    #
    # * +radius+: The radius of the Gaussian operator. The default is 0.0.
    # * +sigma+: The standard deviation of the Gaussian operator. A good starting value is 1.0, which is the default.
    # * +amount+: The percentage of the blurred image to be added to the receiver, specified as a fraction between 0 and 1.0. A good starting value is 1.0, which is the default.
    # * +threshold+: The threshold needed to apply the amount, specified as a fraction between 0 and 1.0. A good starting value is 0.05, which is the default.
    #
    # Example:
    #
    #   @photo.operate do |image|
    #     image.unsharp_mask
    #   end
