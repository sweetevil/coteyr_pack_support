module Fleximage
  module Operator
    
    # Crops the image without doing any resizing first.  The operation crops from the :+from+ coordinate,
    # and returns an image of size :+size+ down and right from there.
    # 
    #   image.crop(options = {})
    #
    # Use the following keys in the +options+ hash:
    #
    # * +gravity+: Select gravity for the crop. Default is :top_left (Magick::NorthWestGravity)
    #   Choose from GRAVITITES constant defined in base.rb.
    # * +from+: coorinates for the upper left corner of resulting image.
    # * +size+: The size of the resulting image, going down and to the right of the :+from+ coordinate.
    # 
    #  size and from options are *required*.
    #
    # Example:
    #
    #   @photo.operate do |image|
    #     image.crop(
    #       :from => '100x50',
    #       :size => '500x350'
    #     )
    #   end
    #
    # or
    #
    #   @photo.operate do |image|
    #     image.crop(
    #       :gravity => :center,
    #       :from    => '100x50',
    #       :size    => '500x350'
    #     )
