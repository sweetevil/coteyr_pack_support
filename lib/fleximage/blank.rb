module Fleximage
  
  # The +Blank+ class allows easy creation of dynamic images for views which depends models that
  # do not store images.  For example, perhaps you want a rendering of a text label, or a comment,
  # or some other type of data that is not inherently image based.
  #
  # Your model doesn't need to know anything about Fleximage.  You can instantiate and operate on
  # a new Fleximage::Blank object right in your view.
  #
  # Usage:
  # 
  #   Fleximage::Blank.new(size, options = {}).operate { |image| ... }
  #
  # Use the following keys in the +options+ hash:
  #
  # * color: the color the image will be.  Can be a named color or a Magick::Pixel object.
  #   
  # Example:
  #
  #   # app/views/comments/show.png.flexi
  #   Fleximage::Blank.new('400x150')).operate do |image|
  #     # Start with a chat bubble image as the background
  #     image.image_overlay('public/images/comment_bubble.png')
  #     
  #     # Assuming that the user model acts_as_fleximage, this will draw the users image.
  #     image.image_overlay(@comment.user.file_path,
  #       :size => '50x50',
  #       :alignment => :top_left,
  #       :offset => '10x10'
  #     )
  #     
  #     # Add the author name text
  #     image.text(@comment.author,
  #       :alignment => :top_left,
  #       :offset => '10x10',
  #       :color => 'black',
  #       :font_size => 24,
  #       :shadow => {
  #         :blur => 1,
  #         :opacity => 0.5,
  #       }
  #     )
  #     
  #     # Add the comment body text
  #     image.text(@comment.body, 
  #       :alignment => :top_left,
  #       :offset => '10x90',
  #       :color => color(128, 128, 128),
  #       :font_size => 14
