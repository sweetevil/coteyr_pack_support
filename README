CoteyrPack
=====
A plugin used to reduce some of the more repetitive tasks when starting and developing a Ruby on Rails project. Included are some basic plugins that have been branched and modified to work in a better fashion.

Examples
=====
Some quick rake tasks to make things go eaiser

rake coteyr_pack:first_time     # Copy Application.html.erb and other first time
                                # files. Only run once per project
rake coteyr_pack:setup          # Use this task to install coteyr_pack (safe to
                                # run after an update).


The following will only work under linux (with kde and kdialog)

rake coteyr_pack:linux:auto_test    # Run Autotest
rake coteyr_pack:linux:commit       # Commits using ~/.bin/commit
rake coteyr_pack:linux:console      # Run the console
rake coteyr_pack:linux:controller   # Run the Controller Generator wrapper
rake coteyr_pack:linux:log          # View Logs
rake coteyr_pack:linux:menu         # This starts the Ease of use Menu
rake coteyr_pack:linux:migrate      # Run the DB Migrator wrapper
rake coteyr_pack:linux:migration    # Run the Migration Generator wrapper
rake coteyr_pack:linux:model        # Run the Model Generator
rake coteyr_pack:linux:pull         # Update local Repo using ~/.bin/pull
rake coteyr_pack:linux:server       # Start the dev server
rake coteyr_pack:linux:test_all     # Run All tests


Note about included works
=====
Most of the heavy lifting in this plugin is the work of custom code. Sometimes a
plugin will become unmaintained (or be refactored in a way that was contrary to what
I felt was the best method). At such a time I branch that plugin and merge it into
coteyr_pack. In these cases the original copyright holders are noted in the source
files to the best of my ability.

Usage Notes
=====
This plugin is intended to be used in house by Coteyr.net Programming LLC. As such
scripts and other resources that are needed to allow this plugin to function, certain
configurations, and code conventions are followed that may be contrary to main stream
RoR development, or your workflow. Be advised that no modification will be made to
this plugin to extend it to your workflow/configuration/or conventions. You should
create your own plugin for that.
