    <hr/>
    <p>
      This is most often cause by pointing your DOCUMENT_ROOT at the root of the rails project directory and not the project's public directory.<br/>
      You should point the DOCUMENT_ROOT at the public directory of your rails project instead of the projects root directory when using Apache and
      passenger (mod rails) or any other integrated environment. If you are seeing this message and your using mongrel or other dedicated application
      servers then your service configuration files are incorrect.
